**Welcome to our GPS Drifter GitHub (forked) repository! :ocean: :satellite:
  
  Project by Steven Anderson, Cole Argay, Maya Leighton, and Ben Middour**

  In here you can find some necessary files for our GPS-tracked drifter including the previous code used for a similar project with depth and temperature sensors; our code, which is just for GPS and cellular connectivity; the continuinty report; and other figures regarding the hardware and physical drifter.

  This project and GitHub is still a work in progress! Start by looking at the continuity report in the Project-Information folder, which outlines what we did for this project as well as future work that needs to be undertaken!
